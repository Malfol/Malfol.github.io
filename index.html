  <h1>Hey guys, it's been a long time since I joined. It's been an honor to be with you through all the hard work. We have reached 400 members and I'm super happy for that. This is my biggest project, and I'd like to not keep it the last.
  All the things that happened since i joined : 
  Hiamoli creating the server 18th Febuary 2O25
  The first person to join the server was Matinoo Now the Second Owner
   I joined Febuary 19th 2025
   First guy to became staff was cinar now long gone
    i was the second to became staff and i became moderator and made my way to owner
    then we started taking people in like - Matinoo , SwipedColor , Snowy , Molda
    Then there was our first raid so we had to restore the whole server and it was kinda a good thing cuz we made a whole rebrand
    then i made a site called tdarksector.mysellauth.com that sold over 6 configs and im really happy for that i even wanted to do a cheat resell but now i dont feel like it.
    Since Febuary 18th to 11th May we have managed to have 400 members acive on our server
    (today is my birthday so happy birthday to me ig)
     AND ALL THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED DURING THIS TIME ON DARKSECTOR HONESTLY IM SURPRISED HOW ACTIVE YALL WERE AND IM REALLY THANKFULL FOR THAT
     SO THIS IS THE END LAST BYE. </h1>
