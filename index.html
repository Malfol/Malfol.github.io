  <h1>Final Message from TDS</h1>
  <p>Hey everyone,</p>
  <p>It's been a long and amazing journey. Being part of this server and watching it grow has been an honor. I'm incredibly proud to announce we've reached 400 membersâ€”an incredible milestone for what has been my biggest project yet.</p>
  
  <p>Hereâ€™s a quick look back at our timeline:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Server created by Hiamoli on February 18, 2025</li>
    <li>First member: Matinoo (now Co-Owner)</li>
    <li>I joined on February 19, 2025</li>
    <li>First staff member: Cinar (now gone)</li>
    <li>I became the second staff member, worked up to Moderator, and eventually became Owner</li>
    <li>Key contributors joined: Matinoo, SwipedColor, Snowy, Molda</li>
    <li>We faced our first raid, which led to a full server rebrandâ€”a blessing in disguise</li>
    <li>Created our own site: <a href="https://tdarksector.mysellauth.com">tdarksector.mysellauth.com</a>, selling over 6 configs</li>
    <li>Thought about launching a cheat resell, but changed course</li>
    <li>As of today, May 11, 2025 (and my birthday!), we've hit 400 active members ðŸŽ‰</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This has all been possible because of YOU. Your support, activity, and energy kept the server alive, and I can't thank you enough.</p>

  <p>So, with a grateful heartâ€”this is the end. My last goodbye.</p>

  <p><strong>Thank you all. Stay awesome.</strong></p>
  <p>â€” TDS</p>
